Nutrient Supplementation on the Health Status of Pre-Pubertal Children: A Meta-Analysis
=================================================================================================

ABSTRACT

Background:
Multiple studies have been carried out to assess the effect of nutrient supplements on
children’s health either through direct vitamin and mineral supplementation, food
fortification or both. The results of these studies are inconsistent, and the factors behind
these varied outcomes are unknown.

Objective:
Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, randomized placebo control trials and
retrospective difference-in-difference evaluations were therefore completed to assess the
effect of nutrient supplementation on the health of children ages 0-5 years in developing
countries.

Design:
A total of 18 acceptable studies published in the last 20 years were identified by searches
in journals of renowned reputation, such as The Lancet (American and British editions),
The Journal of Nutrition, The American Journal of Nutrition and The Journal of
Pediatrics. These studies identified clear outcomes that would measure changes in the
nutritional status of the population (mainly variations in stunting, wasting, infant
mortality, anemia). The factors associated with effect sizes were explored by metaregression
techniques.

Results:
The overall effect of nutrition supplements on health outcomes was positive although the
studies indicate that nearly half of all interventions (7 out of 18 studies) had a neutral
effect. In this meta-analysis, the impacts might be influenced by design features such as
the type of intervention and sample size. The impacts might also vary by geographical
location and by infants who are breast-fed versus those who are not. However, a metaregression
of these factors on study outcomes reveals that these factors are insignificant
(p>0.1).

Conclusions:
Interventions to improve children’s health should be considered in populations at risk of
undernourishment, especially where there are elevated rates of disease or mortality.
However, policymakers should think twice about distributing certain supplements, like
iron tablets, to children who have malaria or other diseases as preexisting underlying
conditions. In these cases, interventions to address malnutrition should be complemented
with interventions toward disease control and management.
